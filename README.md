Motorola 68000 emulation engine, kinda

This was created to emulate the M68K processor. But also, you know, to have a fun challenge ;)

## Example
This repo comes with a simple example project.

# Plans

## Near-term

Complete Motorola 68000 support (as of right now, this engine supports only a subset of the M68K instruction set with no interrupts)
