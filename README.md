Motorola 68000 emulation engine, kinda

This was created to emulate the M68K processor. But also, you know, to have a fun challenge ;)

## Example

This repo comes with two simple example projects, one of them being a basic M68K arcade ROM launcher.

# Plans

## Near-term

Complete Motorola 68000 support (as of right now, this engine supports only a subset of the M68K instruction set with only basic interrupt support)
